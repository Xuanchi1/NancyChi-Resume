        <p class="lead mb-4">Education is always the most important action for the worldâ€™s improvement, and it is also important to build everyoneâ€™s life and worldview before they get mature and have their own ability to think. According to Labaree (1989), most of the students in high school canâ€™t really learn knowledge from the teacher. Most teachers give tons of exercise paper to the students to work on in class, and they do their own things. Thatâ€™s very common in todayâ€™s education, in my own opinion. I have seen teachers giving tons of assignments to the students and never correcting the assignments on time. If the assignment was turned in, the grade would be 100%. And for those students who didnâ€™t learn anything from the class and got a bad grade on the exams? Most of the teachers would decide to give extra credit to keep the course grade average. Labaree (1989) stated that the high school diploma is more like a certificate of attendance than an achievement. With the expectation of society that if there are too many people who can't graduate from high school, it means that the country and society are behind. With the high society pressure, the high school, of course, is going to lower the requirements until it becomes like the characters in Teachers. My own opinion to improve the education of K-12 students would have every teacher understand what their job is and what the students should receive. By understanding the teacherâ€™s job, I mean each teacher should really have lectures and useful sheets of exercise for the students. Students have to go to elementary school to learn basic skills and knowledge. Students have to go to middle school to find out what their goal and talent are. When each student comes to high school, teachers should give the correct grade to show the studentâ€™s skill. Some students might be better in the STEM fields and bad at English. Some students might like more history than math. It is fine for the students to have their own interests, but it is also more important for the teachers to let the students know their level so they can choose the major and courses that match them. According to Flanagan (2016), most parents want their kids to go to school because they can get a better job. The truth is that high-salary jobs always have high requirements. But is getting a high-paying job really the purpose of education? As an education major student and willing to be a teacher, I would say that education is for people to find their passion. From the two documents, I see high expectations from people to get a good grade from K-12. The expectation is over their passion and over their knowledge. I think education should not be directly related to a better job. Instead, education should be pure; it should be about knowledge, learning, and exploring. A high school diploma should be an achievement, and a better job should be related to personal ability.<br><br>

        Emperor elementary school was the first school I attended in the United States. This is one of the public elementary schools in the Temple City district, California. The community around the school is an ideal place to live. I have lived in this safe and diverse community since I moved to America. In the neighborhood, all the people were friendly, and the environment inside the school and around my house was clean and green. The street I lived on was the backstreet of my elementary school. My home was so close to the school that I joined a group of children that walked to school every morning. As every morning children will walk together in this group to go to school. We usually go through the back door to get into school. I still remember the first day I attended this elementary school. My first thought about the school when I walked into it was that the environment was full of happiness. I spent a couple of years attending elementary school in China, which is different from what I see at Emperor Elementary. Back in China, we can hear students readinh out loud the homework that the teacher assigned from yesterday, when classes did not even start. The only thing I could feel from my China elementary school was full of pressure from the environment and the teacher. Moreover, I hear the students laughing, playing, and waiting for class to start at Emperor Elementary school.The school has the majority of Asian people. I can even hear people speaking my language while they walk to their classrooms. Attending a school like this with a great environment makes me want to be a part of the students. In this school, I learned a lot of subjects and knowledge, but most importantly, I can learn more skills like social skills. I used to be a timid person in a high-pressure environment. There is no need to make friends with other people because I do not even have the time to finish my homework. However, everything changed after I came to this elementary school. I can live a social life as well as an academic life. The community around the school is excellent. It makes me feel safe after school walking home with my friends. In addition, many resources are available for students in a couple of miles away from school. For example, the city library is open six days a week and closes late so students can spend their after-school time studying and doing their homework. After-school programs and church-free classes are also popular. From these places, students can complete their knowledge from the class on that day and prepare it for the next day's class. These resources benefit students, and most students would spend their time before dinner at these resources. I attended the The World Is Your Classroom studying abroad event at eleven am on October 19, 2022, at the HUB 355. This event was presented by assistant director LaSharon A McLean Perez, academic advisor Richard Rangel, and Interim Associate Dean Robert Ream. I learned a lot from this event. During the presentation, the presenters cleared a lot of doubts about studying abroad and provided more information about the process. They have also shared their experiences about studying abroad. And from their experiences, I believe it is not just a learning experience, but a lifelong memory.  The assistant director had two guests who had just returned from studying abroad. The advice I learned from them is to apply for scholarships and prepare to adapt to new environments and emergency situations. It was an enjoyable and helpful experience to attend this event. <br><br>

        According to the Public School Review (2022), Emperor Elementary serves a total of seven hundred and two students. Sixty-two percent of the students are Asian in this school, twenty-four percent are Hispanic, one percent are African Americans, seven percent are white Americans, and two percent are two or more races. In the community, sixty-three point six-three percent of Asians, twenty-one point fifty-five percent of white Americans, zero point forty-nine percent of African Americans, and eight point one seven percent of other races (Temple City, California population, 2022). Therefore, the race in the school and the community is close. For the social economy of the students, thirty-one percent of students qualify for free lunch, and eight percent qualify for reduced lunch. The community's poverty rate is ten point zero eight percent, which is slightly different. The median income of people living in temple city is $97,082 (PSR, 2022). Only seven point eight percent of people who live in Temple City have an education less than ninth grade. Five percent of the people were in ninth to twelfth grade, and twenty-one percent of people graduated from high school. sixteen percent of people had a college degree, eight percent had an associate degree, twenty-eight percent had a bachelor's degree, and thirteen percent had a graduate degree (PSR, 2022). The research and observations showed us that the school is directly related to the community around it. As we can see, people in the community have a similar percentage compared to the students in school. The community has more than sixty percent of Asian people in the neighborhood, which would relax me from the nervousness of being a new immigrant to the United States. The community research result is close to my observation of the community and the school. It has a high percentage of Asian people, the same as  I observed at school. The community has a majority of people with high education, so the environment is clean and comfortable. As I observed from the school, the pressure is not that strong, and it is the same as we can see from the community. People are happy and friendly. Only ten percent of the people are in poverty, which is much lower than California cities' average rate. Based on the research, the community needs another city library for the students. The library is far away for elementary or middle school students who cannot drive, so it takes more time to walk to the library after school. After-school and church service courses are already enough. With all this in mind, remembering where we came from can take us farther. The biggest challenge in my educational journey would be the pandemic. That was really a serious challenge for the education field. The pandemic is progressing toward the year 2019. whole world. And my high school was forced to turn all the classes into online classes. This challenge emerged so quickly that most of the students and teachers were not able to prepare for it. I still remember that the first half year after the pandemic barely started, Online class attendance is not required. No lectures were given that half year, and the most ridiculous part is that I got all A's in that half year. I really want to make some changes to this. I believe that, just as soldiers are always preparing for battles, teachers should always be preparing for anything that can interrupt the class order. No matter what happens in an emergency, teaching should never stop. As I'm choosing this education major today, my goal is to become a teacher and teach our next generation. I truly wish that every teacher understands the responsibility of becoming a teacher as their first lesson. We are now living with the pandemic in our nation, just like teachers who work with students to help them achieve their goals.
